## Summary
The system I chose to model was a resell store. The program consisted of eight classes: Bag, Customer, Human, Item, Shoe, Staff, Store, and StoreMain. The aggregation relationships were between Store-Customer, Store-Staff, Store-Bag, and Store-Shoe. These were aggregation relationships because the Store class referenced other objects in its attributes. For example, a resell store has customers, staff, bags, and shoes. In particular, I used an Array List for my customers, as there would be multiple customers that would be able to sign up and enter their information to participate in the auction. The rest of the attributes were objects that I set the values for, so the users would know who the staff were and what items were up for auction. 

The inheritance relationships were present between the Human-Staff, Human-Customer, Item-Bag, and Item-Shoe. These were inheritance relationships because a Staff and a Customer are both Humans. Similarly, a Bag and a Shoe is an Item as well. Thus, the Human and Item classes were more general while the Bag, Shoe, Customer, and Staff classes were more specific. For example, the Item superclass had variables for the colourway, price, brand, and item type, but the Shoe subclass included more specific variables, such as size, and model and the Bag subclass included season, and bag type variables. Since bags do not have sizes or model names and shoes do not have seasons or bag types, it was appropriate to separate them into different subclasses extending the Item superclass. Moreover, the Human superclass had variables for first name and last name, but the Customer subclass had more specific variables, such as address, and card number while the Staff subclass had variables for job-title and job experience. Since customers do not job titles or job experience at the store and the staff do not need addresses or card numbers, it would be appropriate to separate them into subclasses that extended the Human superclass. 

To tie the whole program together, I made an auction. The customers would be introduced to the store by the staff and then would move on to make accounts. When the user inputs blank as the first name, the loop would end and the program would move on. The bidding would then start for the two items that were being auctioned. The customers would take turns inputting bids. Once everyone else no longer wanted to bid, the person with the highest bid would win. If the user enters 0 or a number less than the starting or highest bid, it would count as a skip. When there would be a round where everyone skips (enters 0 or lower than the starting bid), the auction for the item would end. If there were no bids, there would be no winner and the program would move on.
